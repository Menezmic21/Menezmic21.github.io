As a believer in human potential, I am passionate about using data and creativity to serve and give back to the community. 

I am a third-year student at Rice University majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with a strong academic background. With proficiency in Python and Java, I collaborated with other researchers at OptimaLab to create and analyze neural networks that explore cutting-edge techniques in continual learning, machine unlearning, and distributed learning. 

For me, while technology is important, it is a means to serve people. I help to create, and I create to help. 

I am always excited to hear from like-minded individuals, and I look forward to any opportunities to advance technology in the service of people!
