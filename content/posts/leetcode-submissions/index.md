Here, you'll find problems solved using a variety of data structures, algorithms, and approaches.

Most problems were coded in Java.

Through solving these problems, I have reinforced the knowledge I've gained from class, become better able to identify which problem-solving strategy to use, and how to implement it quickly. My favorite techniques are two pointers (binary search included) and backtracking for how versatile they are. I also enjoyed solving problems using tries (for efficient searching) and two priority queues (for optimization subject to a constraint) as thereâ€™s something beautiful about their complex elegance.

### Data structures

- Array-backed lists
- Linked lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Priority queues
- Hash sets
- Hash maps
- Trees
- Tries
- Graphs

### Algorithms

- Sorting
- Binary search
- Two pointers
- Prefix sum
- Bit manipulation
- Dynamic programming
- Backtracking
- Graph search (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, etc.)

### Approaches

- Brute force
- Top-down
- Bottom-up
- Math
