# What I did

During a general Computer-Aided Design (CAD) training over the summer, the CAD lead saw potential and scouted me. From then, I started to follow the CAD lead and got a closer look into the design of the robot. The CAD lead asked me to design the color wheel subsystem. This subsystem interfaced with a wheel of fortune like obstacle on the field. It had to spin the wheel to a certain color. For our robot to fit in the trench while still being able to reach the wheel. The robot had to deploy spinner mechanism from a folded in position. However, we also had a motor limit. So, I implemented the mechanism deployment and spinning using a coaxial design.

# What I used

CAD models were made using Solidworks.

# Challenges

Since this was my first design for the team. The design reviews were some what stressful where the mentors and leadership asked questions, made critiques, and offered suggestions while I presented my design. After going though a couple of reviews, I started to understand that we all had the same goal and their comments were to help make my designs better.
