# What I did

Due to COVID, last year's season was cut short and this year's season was last year's challenge repeated with compatitions made virtual. As the CAD lead, I was in charge of the Game Design Challenge. We had to prepare materials for a hypothetical game that we would like to see. We even went so far as to make our own 3D animation for a game reveal. Our submission ended up winning our division!

# What I used

CAD models were made using Solidworks and animated with Blender.

# Challenges

Making 3D animations was tough as there was a steep learning curve to get into it. After watching several turorials, I was able to import my models from solidworks, change the appearance of materials, and use keyframes to animate them.
