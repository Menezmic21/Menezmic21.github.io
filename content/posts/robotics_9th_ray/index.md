# What I did

As a high school freshman, I spent the season gaining experience on the mechanical subteam. I built a couple of prototypes and learned how electronics interfaced with the physical world thorugh motors.

I also got the opportunity to work on the competition robot (which is rare as a freshman). It wasn't much, but I helped assemble the drive train. Here, I learned about how our programming team used the input from physical rotary encorders to determine how fast our robot was traveling.

# What I used

Prototypes were made using wood and Vex motors.

# Challenges

The main challenges I experienced around this time were juggling all my commitments while still making meaningful contributions. In addition to robotics, I was also competing in Science Bowl, Texas State Math League, and Science Fair. I managed this by making use of every minute I got. During lunch and between classes, I would work on assignments and make sure that I planned what I was going to work on when.
