      <description>Leetcode logo&#xD;Link to REPO.&#xA;Here, you&amp;rsquo;ll find problems solved using a variety of data structures, algorithms, and approaches.&#xA;Most problems were coded in Java.&#xA;Through solving these problems, I have reinforced the knowledge I&amp;rsquo;ve gained from class, become better able to identify which problem-solving strategy to use, and how to implement it quickly. My favorite techniques are two pointers (binary search included) and backtracking for how versatile they are.</description>

      <title>OptimaLab: Transformer with Independent Subnetwork Training</title>

      <description>Transformer architecture&#xD;This research project seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of Independent Subnetwork Training (IST) methods on the Transformer architecture. A transformer is a type of neural network that is often used for natural language processing. Transformers are made up of attention heads which are modules that &amp;ldquo;learn&amp;rdquo; how which &amp;ldquo;words&amp;rdquo; in a sentence are &amp;ldquo;important.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;To explain exactly what this research project does, I will first explain machine learning in general.</description>

      <title>Rice Datathon 2024: Oil Production Prediction</title>

      <description>Rice datathon splash screen&#xD;Link to DEVPOST.&#xA;Inspiration&#xD;Oil is ubiquitous. From the plastics used in smartphones to the gas that keeps our homes warm, oil drives America moving forward. Living in Houston, a major oil center, we understand the importance of oil in daily life. We took on the Chevron track to investigate how oil well characteristics can help predict peak production enabling oil companies to make informed decisions and run more efficiently.</description>

      <description>Rice datathon splash screen&#xD;Link to DEVPOST.&#xA;What it does and how we built it&#xD;We first cleaned the data given, focusing on the most recent population numbers from 2019, as well as limiting demographics to females, since they are the ones who receive mammograms, and limiting facility locations to the mainland 50 states. We then calculated the expected number of women who could be diagnosed with breast cancer in each state using incidence rates from an external dataset from the National Cancer Institute.</description>

      <description>HMNS dinosaur exhibit&#xD;Link to HMNS.&#xA;What I did&#xD;During the summer of 2019, I worked as an intern in the Astronomy department. My daily duties consisted of leading guided tours for museum visitors and summer camp attendees. In addition to this, I conducted surveys and analyzed the results to scaffold future tours and planetarium shows. I was lucky to have interned with the Houston Museum of Natural Science (HMNS) in 2019 as it was the 60th anniversary of Apollo.</description>

      <description>As a believer in human potential, I am passionate about using data and creativity to serve and give back to the community.&#xA;I am a third-year student at Rice University majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with a strong academic background. With proficiency in Python and Java, I collaborated with other researchers at OptimaLab to create and analyze neural networks that explore cutting-edge techniques in continual learning, machine unlearning, and distributed learning.</description>
