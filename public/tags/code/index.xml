      <description>Leetcode logo&#xD;Link to REPO.&#xA;Here, you&amp;rsquo;ll find problems solved using a variety of data structures, algorithms, and approaches.&#xA;Most problems were coded in Java.&#xA;Through solving these problems, I have reinforced the knowledge I&amp;rsquo;ve gained from class, become better able to identify which problem-solving strategy to use, and how to implement it quickly. My favorite techniques are two pointers (binary search included) and backtracking for how versatile they are.</description>

      <title>OptimaLab: Transformer with Independent Subnetwork Training</title>

      <description>Transformer architecture&#xD;This research project seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of Independent Subnetwork Training (IST) methods on the Transformer architecture. A transformer is a type of neural network that is often used for natural language processing. Transformers are made up of attention heads which are modules that &amp;ldquo;learn&amp;rdquo; how which &amp;ldquo;words&amp;rdquo; in a sentence are &amp;ldquo;important.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;To explain exactly what this research project does, I will first explain machine learning in general.</description>

      <description>Machine unlearning kaggle competition&#xD;Link to KAGGLE.&#xA;Deep learning has recently driven tremendous progress in a wide array of applications, ranging from realistic image generation and impressive retrieval systems to language models that can hold human-like conversations. While this progress is very exciting, the widespread use of deep neural network models requires caution: researchers should seek to develop AI technologies responsibly by understanding and mitigating potential risks, such as the propagation and amplification of unfair biases and protecting user privacy.</description>

      <description>Rice datathon splash screen&#xD;Link to DEVPOST.&#xA;Inspiration&#xD;Oil is ubiquitous. From the plastics used in smartphones to the gas that keeps our homes warm, oil drives America moving forward. Living in Houston, a major oil center, we understand the importance of oil in daily life. We took on the Chevron track to investigate how oil well characteristics can help predict peak production enabling oil companies to make informed decisions and run more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Rice Datathon 2023: Breast Cancer Equity</title>

      <description>Rice datathon splash screen&#xD;Link to DEVPOST.&#xA;What it does and how we built it&#xD;We first cleaned the data given, focusing on the most recent population numbers from 2019, as well as limiting demographics to females, since they are the ones who receive mammograms, and limiting facility locations to the mainland 50 states. We then calculated the expected number of women who could be diagnosed with breast cancer in each state using incidence rates from an external dataset from the National Cancer Institute.</description>

      <title>Texas Torque: Armageddon</title>

      <description>Armageddon&#xD;Link to BLUE ALLIANCE.&#xA;What I did&#xD;After years of disuse and being scrapped for parts, the team decided to restore the robot. I updated the code of the robot. This involved configuring the Xbox controllers to run motors/actuate pneumatics; tuning Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control loops; and adding cameras to implement computer vision. In addition, despite the drive train on Armageddon being an H-drive, I was able to simulate a swerve drive using an Inertial Measurement Unit.</description>

      <description>Nimbus&#xD;Link to BLUE ALLIANCE.&#xA;What I did&#xD;As vice-president, I oversaw the entire team. I helped solve specific problems within subteams while also mediating disputes between subteams. Some other duties I had were training the underclassmen to make them self-sufficient and designing the magazine (the mechanism responsible for moving the ball from the intake to the shooter) for the robot. Since I was the former CAD lead, I helped the CAD team and programming find parameters for their mechanisms.</description>

      <title>SIR Mobility Metapopulation Models: Designing an Epidemic Model</title>

      <description>SIR model with two communities&#xD;Over the past century, there has been a continual increase in the probability of pandemics as a result of heightened global travel and urbanization. These pandemics have sever repercussions which decrease the labor force, amplify social tensions, and augment partisanship. In order to concentrate mitigation efforts, accurate epidemic forecasts are essential. In particular to this study, metapopulation models are of interest as they incorporate how individuals travel between communities providing a deeper understanding of how epidemics spread.</description>
