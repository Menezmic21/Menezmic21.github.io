      <description>HMNS dinosaur exhibit&#xD;Link to HMNS.&#xA;What I did&#xD;During the summer of 2019, I worked as an intern in the Astronomy department. My daily duties consisted of leading guided tours for museum visitors and summer camp attendees. In addition to this, I conducted surveys and analyzed the results to scaffold future tours and planetarium shows. I was lucky to have interned with the Houston Museum of Natural Science (HMNS) in 2019 as it was the 60th anniversary of Apollo.</description>
